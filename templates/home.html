      <p class="lead">
        It’s hard to move on and let go. But it’s your mindset that can be your
        greatest asset or worst enemy. One ending is not your end. You can use a
        divorce or separation as a chance to work on yourself and transform.
        Pain can be a great catalyst. That’s why it’s great to have someone on
        your team who can aid you. And I’m that person who can help you get
        there. I’m a breakup recovery/attachment coach who helps clients heal,
        let go, and move on from old individuals and patterns, so that they
        experience a wholesome, healthy self-love and marriage. My sessions are
        affordable, transformative, and life-changing. We begin by analyzing
        your past and prior choices to uncover your limiting beliefs and stored
        associations. Then, we work together on healing old wounds and setting
        in action plans through a myriad of exercises to help you overcome these
        challenges. Last, we ensure that you implement the plan and track your
        progress. I’m with you every step of the way. Having a coach is the best
        way to learn new strategies, stay motivated, and keep yourself
        accountable. You don’t need to be a lone wolf. You can finally get the
        support and encouragement you deserve.
